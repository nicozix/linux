# What Is Linux?
Although Linux is criticized by people alot because you have to use the Terminal on a daily basis and seems hard, it's actually not that complicated. Linux is a free & open-source operating system anyone can tinker with. With its wide variety of distributions and all with their own quirks, you can find what suits you best.

If you really wanna look into Linux and take the time to learn to use it (like using the terminal), you're gonna have a good interest in it. Since you have freedoom in linux because everything is open-source , you can control and adjust any aspect of your desktop, unlike Windows. You have the freedom to distribute, run, copy read and modify anything inside the system. Since Linux is 100% open-source (Including Programs), you don't have to worry about being tracked and spied unlike Windows and its software.

Another great reason to use Linux is because of its great security. With Windows, most of the time when you want to download something, you go to the internet and download an EXE/MSI executable (security risk). Linux uses package managers where repositories are managed and verified by the community. Another pro of Linux being open-source is that the code can be viewed by anyone. You may think this is terrible for security, but the pros outweigh the cons. Because of the community being able to look at and contribute to the codebase, bugs and security risks can be resolved quicker.

Minecraft and Counter Strike run faster out of the box than Windows. Instead of wasting time 'tweaking' and trimming a closed-source ISO (Windows), you can build whatever you want from the ground up.

# Installing Linux
**First Step › Download A Distribution**
For new Linux users, I would recommend using Linux Mint as your first distro. It's easy to use and it has 'out of the box' applications for work and daily usage. Download the Image file at https://www.linuxmint.com/download.php. There are 3 Desktop Environments to choose from, so go with whatever looks nice to you.

**Second Step › Burning the .iso to a bootable USB drive**
Burn the .iso using Balena Etcher: https://balena.io/etcher
Make sure to select the right drive!

**Last Step › Booting into USB Drive**
Once you boot into the USB, proceed with everything. The procedure isn't complicated so I don't need to explain anything
